Issue : How to avaoid .svn folder locally while don't want to submit to Git repo
Answer : in Visual studio simply right click & Ignor .svn folder
After that, changes applied automatically in .gitignor file and then commit this file to git repo

Issue : When creating new project like cross platform app through Visual studio
with Git. And submitting project to git remote repo on to master branch, 
it won't allow to push changes

Solution-Ref : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23401652/fatal-the-current-branch-master-has-no-upstream-branch

git pull --rebase git_url(Ex: https://github.com/username/reponame.git)
git push origin master

If it shows any fatal error regarding upstream after any future push then simply run :

git push --set-upstream origin master

Remove directory from git and local
You could checkout 'master' with both directories;

git rm -r one-of-the-directories
git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)
Remove directory from git but NOT local
As mentioned in the comments, what you usually want to do is remove this directory from git but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local)

In that case use:

git rm -r --cached myFolder
